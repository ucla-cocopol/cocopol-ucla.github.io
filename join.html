            <h2>Joining</h2>
            <p style="font-size:2.3vh;line-height: 1.5;">Our lab is growing, with several PhD positions available over the coming years, including Fall 2025. If you're interested, please reach out!</p>

            <h3>Prospective PhD students</h3>
            <p style="font-size:2.3vh;line-height: 1.5;">I will be reviewing Ph.D. applications in the upcoming cycle (deadline: December 1, 2024) for students interested in starting in September 2025. Prospective students can apply through the <a href="https://comm.ucla.edu/graduate/admissions/" target="_blank">UCLA Communication PhD program</a>. Please feel free to reach out to <a href="mailto:rdubey@princeton.edu">rdubey@princeton.edu</a> if you wish to apply and want to make contact beforehand.</p>

            <p style="font-size:2.3vh;line-height: 1.5;">Ideally, my lab will include students of diverse expertise: (1) 1-2 students with background in cognitive science, (2) 1-2 student with climate policy interests (e.g., background in sustainability, policy, economics), and (3) 1-2 students who are fluent in reinforcement learning or machine learning. What will distinguish my lab is that pretty much everyone in it will be interested in human behavior and climate change, and will have strong quantitative training and coding skills.</p>

            <p style="font-size:2.3vh;line-height: 1.5;">Prospective students should have a strong interest in working on climate change and doing basic research in cognition, along with a solid technical background. This includes experience in areas such as web development, data analysis, mathematical modeling, or machine learning. While a strong foundation in cognitive science is preferred, we are also excited to hear from people who would bring new expertise. Here are some excellent resources on applying to grad school and writing a strong application: <a href="https://www.brains-explained.com/advice-for-applying-to-phd-programs/" target="_blank">[1]</a>, <a href="https://lucylai.com/blog/gradapps" target="_blank">[2]</a>, and <a href="https://www.katenuss.com/advice/applying_to_phd/" target="_blank">[3]</a>.</p>
            
            <h3>Prospective postdoctoral researchers</h3>
            <p style="font-size:2.3vh;line-height: 1.5;">I currently don't have any funding for postdocs, but if you have shared research interests and have fellowships or funding sources you envision applying, please reach out. I am happy to discuss opportunities!</p>
